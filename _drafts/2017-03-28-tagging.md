## Quick reminder what is **frisor**

**Frisor** is a web application in **Python/Django** which is just a box for interesting urls. When using untrusted network
I don't want to login anywhere to save interesting content I found. More about this is here:
[Introduction to frisor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-01-introduction_to_frisor.md %}).

I introduced tags for my urls. As I didn't want to reinvent a wheel again,
I decided to use some django library for tagging. More about my experiences in next part of
this post.

**Frisor** on github: [firsor repo](https://github.com/vevurka/frisor).

Currently my application looks like this:

## Tagging

django-tagging:
to many tables in database: tagging_taggeditem and tagging_tag
sqlite> select * from tagging_tag;
