TODO: PSPACE w oddzielnym paraagrafie, wstęp zrobić


This post will be about some very important and unsolved problems in Computer Science
and a reasons why it matters in case of AI.

### $$P$$ versus $$NP$$? There is also $$PSPACE$$...

$$P$$, $$NP$$ and $$PSPACE$$ are sets of decision problems.

Problems in $$P$$ are to be solved using polynomial time. For $$NP$$ problems we can verify
if a solution is correct using polynomial time. It means for solving in polynomial time
some $$P$$ problems we need a deterministic Touring machine, but for $$NP$$ problems we
will need a non-deterministic one (which doesn't exist except theory). And this also means
that when solving problem in $$NP$$ on deterministic Touring machine we *might* need
exponential time.

Greatest common divisor is an example of $$P$$ problem. The most known $$NP$$ problems are:

* traveling salesman problem
* boolean satisfiability problem ($$SAT$$).

We have also $$PSPACE$$ set of problems - they can be solved by deterministic Touring
machine in polynomial space (not time!). Some examples:

* Quantified Boolean formula problem ($$QBF$$)
* Reversi (game)
* Mahjong (game)
* Chess and GO (when we have constraint for number of moves, otherwise they are
proven to be even harder than $$PSPACE$$)

$$
P \subseteq NP \subseteq PSPACE
$$

We still don't know if this two relations are only inclusions or equalities also.
It's the most important puzzle in Computer Science. If there will be a prove
that $$P=NP$$ then all our cryptography (SSL) will be unsafe, but I don't want to focus on
this here, because there is plenty information about this.

For me on the first sight wasn't obvious why $$ NP \subseteq PSPACE $$. But when I thought
that you can iterate for exponential time using polynomial space it became clear
that $$PSPACE$$ problems are not easier than problems in $$NP$$.


### $$SAT$$ and $$QBF$$
Boolean satisfiability problem ($$SAT$$) is about checking if given propositional logical
formula is satisfiable. It's proven that $$SAT$$ is $$NP$$-complete (so every problem
which is in $$NP$$ is at least less hard than $$SAT$$) and it's not my point to prove
that here. If you want to find it search for Cook–Levin theorem.
Of course there are some variants of $$SAT$$ problems with added constraints that are
in $$P$$ - for example $$2-SAT$$ (when the number of literals in clause is limited to
$$2$$).

Quantified Boolean formula problem ($$QBF$$) is a generalization of $$SAT$$ - we just add
quantifiers (for all - $$ \forall $$ or exists - $$ \exists $$) to given formulas. So we
can say that every theorem has
it's $$QBF$$ form. $$QBF$$ is proven to $$PSPACE$$-complete and $$PSPACE$$ problems are
not easier than $$NP$$ problems.

### What complexity of $$SAT$$ and $$QBF$$ has to do with AI?

Till we don't prove $$ N = NP $$ artificial intelligence machines
which learnt how to code still will need person who would approve the code, because
of their non-deterministic approach. And until we prove even more - that
also $$ PSPACE = NP $$ it will be not possible to even design an algorithm which allow
us to generate a code for given issue. We still can teach AI to do some coding, but
the correctness will be hard to prove (the same as halting problem) - currently there
are only heuristics, they can be better and better, but still it's a
non-deterministic approach which needs to be verified by human.
