I work as a software developer. After work I usually climb or play the piano
(I've to confess - except CS degree I also have a B.A in Piano Performance) or code my small side-projects.

I started programming because I was keen on math more than computers, so I'm interested in algorithms,
theory of programming languages and other weird stuff not necessarily needed every day.

Oh, and I'm not a fan of OOP - I prefer functional paradigm. I like to use diverse tools and I believe
in using right tool for a job instead of focusing on mastering one technology.
